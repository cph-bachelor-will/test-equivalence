# test-equivalence

I tested an old project of mine which consisted of very basic Junit tests.

1. How much of the code is covered by test cases to start out?

Only 9% of the project had been covered by tests.

2. Could and should the code coverage of your project be raised?

Yes, the project code coverafe could and should be raised. Although this was not a project 
deemed important enough for full test coverage.

3. How?

The code could be better covered with further Junit tests, as it is a Java project. More functions
need to be tested, not solely the functions which produce the end results but all the ones used throughout.
